# UIDAI
Problem Statement-4.1 
You have to devise an innovative solution to identify repetitive content (like Delhi in the instant use case) and merge it in a manner that the overall address remains intact and usable.
The solution must comply with the following:- 4.1.1 Essential fields like District and State can be merged into a single entity.
4.1.2 If the repetitive text is a subpart of a field, then merger should be avoided. For example, ‘Purani Delhi’ as locality and ‘Delhi’ as State can’t be merged.
4.1.3 An API is to be developed which will take the address in its raw form as input and optimized/formatted response should be the output. No user interface would be required.
4.1.4 Bonus credit would be given to the team who can also consider the address in the local language and optimize the same. 4.1.5 You can use any open-source technologies to demonstrate the solution.


#Solution
in this problem we uses algorithm and geocode both, but due to unavailability of api subscription both are not merged yet. Hence we are submitting both the solutions.
